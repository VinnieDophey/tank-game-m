        <h1>Tiles:</h1>
        <h2>Rocks</h2>
        <img src="rock.png" alt="Image of Rock Tile in game." />
        <p>
          Rocks are tiles that are unbreakable by player shots, enemy shots, and
          mines. Player and enemy shells shatter on contact with rocks.
        </p>
        <h2>Sand</h2>
        <img src="sand.png" alt="Image of Sand Tile in game." />
        <p>
          Sand are tiles that can be broken by player and enemy shots, and
          enemies can see you behind sand tiles.
        </p>
        <h2>Metal</h2>
        <img src="metal.png" alt="Image of Metal Tile in game." />
        <p>
          Metals are tiles that have a unique hard crystal formations, allowing
          both player shells and enemy shells to bounce instead of spontaniously
          collapsing upon contact. Can make excellent trickshots!
        </p>
        <h1>Player Parts</h1>
        <img
          src="playerTank.png"
          alt="Image of the Player's Tank in game."
          width="20%"
        />
        <h2>Player Body</h2>

        <p>
          The body is the most important part of the Player Tank. It connects
          all different components of the tank. Upon hit, it may suffer minor
          damages or major damages that require five seconds of immobillity to
          fix. Sometimes, the damage is too major and causes the ammunition
          storage to spontaniously combust, leading to the death of all crew
          members.
        </p>
        <h2>Player Wheels</h2>

        <p>
          Wheels are responsible for movement. When commanded to move forward,
          they start at a slow speed and accelerate to the maximum speed. The
          maximum speed is slower while backing up as the drive sprockets,
          idlers, and return rollers are optimized for high-speed forward
          travel, and less so for reverse. When hit, it may suffer mninor
          damages or major damages that render the tank immobile for five
          seconds. In rare cases, the enemy shell can penetrate through the
          wheels into the body where crew members are more prone to dying.
        </p>
        <h2>Player Turret</h2>

        <p>
          Turret is the main offensive aspect of the Player's Tank. It allows
          for long range and precise targeting. Turrets can spin 360 degrees to
          ensure coverage from all fronts, but they spin slowly, so don't get
          flanked! Upon hit, the turret may get disabled - unusable for five
          seconds before it is repaired.
        </p>

        <h2>Player Mines</h2>
        <img src="mine.png" alt="Image of Mines in game." width="20%" />
        <p>
          Mines can be dropped from the Player's Tank. These mines explode upon
          shot, and inflict large damage. It is an almost guarenteed kill if it
          manages to hit the Enemy Tank, but I warn, it also destroys the
          player.
        </p>
        <h1>Enemy parts</h1>
        <img
          src="enemyTank.png"
          alt="Image of the Enemy's Tank in game."
          width="40%"
        />
        <p>
          There are many different variations of the Enemy Tank with different
          abillities. Those are two examples of different colors.
        </p>
        <h2>Enemy Body</h2>
        <p>
          This is the main part of the Enemy's Tank. It is not as protected as
          the player's body due to the lack of sloped armor. Therefore, it is
          easy for the player to penetrate, although sometimes their shells will
          not.
        </p>
        <h2>Enemy Turret</h2>
        <p>
          This is the main offensive unit of the enemy. It shoots in bursts of
          usually three or four. It inflicts high damage and is extremely
          dangerous as multiple of them hit the player in a close timespan.
        </p>
        <h1>Main Gameplay Flow</h1>
        <p>
          The player must destroy all enemy tanks, and then they will
          automatically be deployed the next level.
